Week 5 - Location Reminders

# [Monday - nov 23](nov-23-location/)
### [nov-23-location/](nov-23-location/)
* Get your project setup in Objective-C
* Create a single view controller, that has a map view that takes up most the screen, and 3 buttons below it.
* The 3 buttons should set the region on the map view to 3 cool locations, you pick the locations.
* CODE CHALLENGE: Implement Stack and Queue in Objective-C. You can implement them in the same project as your map app is in, since Objective-C does not support playgrounds.
