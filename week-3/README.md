* Implement an OAuth workflow in your app that successfully lets the user authenticate with your app.
* Implement the keychain service / NSUserDefaults to store the authorization token, so it only does the OAuth process once.
* Create a github service and implement a method that fetches repositories based on a search term.
* Code Challenge: Given an array of ints of odd length, return a new array length 3 containing the elements from the middle of the array. The array length will be at least 3.

* Create / implement login screen. App should check to see if token exists before displaying / making a call to Github. If token does not exist, present login screen.
* Implement the ability to create new repositories using POST request. NOTE: Please make sure you include "repo" in your initial scope when requesting a token.
* Create a model for repository, user and owner.
* Create a HomeViewController and parse through the JSON returned from the server into models. No UI needed at this point, just print the information into the console.
