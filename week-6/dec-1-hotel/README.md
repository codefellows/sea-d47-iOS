* Seed your data base with the JSON payload provided
* Implement Book functionality. Guests should be able to set both, the start and end reservation dates, specify the room they want and finally book it (guest name is required... feel free to add more requirements). 
* EXTRA: Setup an application flow that allows you to query for room availability from a fromDate and toDate range. Users should be able to book a reservation based on the availability.
