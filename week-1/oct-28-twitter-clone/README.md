* UIActivityIndicator
* UINavigationController Review
* Singleton Pattern
* Supporting Dynamic Type

# Twitter Clone
* Setup your cells with autolayout so you can see the entire tweets text. If you get any .... at the end that is probably twitters API being stupid
* Create a 2nd view controller that shows an individual tweet in detail
* Upon clicking a tweet, your interface should push (which means you need a navigation controller) to the 2nd view controller and display the tweet selected, but with a few caveats:
* If the tweet that was selected is a retweet, show the original tweet and the original user
* All of this information is available in the original JSON, you just have to go digging for it, and then add properties to your Tweet class accordingly.

# Coding Challenge
* Return the number of times that the string "hi" appears anywhere in the given string.
