Thursday - Nov 5
================

# Lecture Slides
* Photos framework
* Event Patterns & Delegation & Custom Protocols
* CollectionView Layout
* Gesture Recognizers
* Social Sharing

# Sortagram
* Implement collection view on the HomeViewController to display all available filters already pre-applied on a thumbnail.
* Show / Hide filter collection view in place of ActionSheetController.
* Selecting a filtered thumbnail applies that filter to the current Image in the primary image view.
* Add a pinch gesture recognizer to the GalleryViewController, which decreases/increases the item size upon pinching (use the scale property of the recognizer). Change layout interactively.
* Create a custom protocol and delegate in order to communicate back image selection from GalleryViewController to the HomeViewControllerfor editing.

# Code Challenge
*  Write a function that tests whether a string is a palindrome

# Extra Credits
* Post more than just the image to parse. Add some interface to let the user type in a comment or hashtags to include in the post. In the 2nd view controller in the other tab, be sure to show the comments that go with each picture
* Use the photos framework to create an album that stores a local copy of all the images you upload to parse
* Use the photos framework to present the user with a table view of all their photo albums, selecting an album should take them to the gallery with only the photos from that album shown
* Create a filter that chains together 2 filters.
