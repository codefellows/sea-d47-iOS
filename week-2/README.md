Week 2 - Sortagram
==================
# Monday - nov-2
[nov-2-sortagram](nov-2-sortagram/)

* **SUPER IMPORTANT:** Download Parse's swift starter project and use it for your week 2 app. This comes with Parse's SDKs preinstalled. Here is the link:
* https://www.parse.com/apps/quickstart#parse_data/mobile/ios/swift/new (Links to an external site.)
* Layout an Image view in the center of the screen using autolayout. Give it a ratio of 80% the super views width and height.
* Use the UIImagePickerController and its delegate to use the camera to set the image view’s image. Add a button on top of the UIImageView that brings up ActionController if the device supports Camera and Photo Library, if not, simply present Photo library.
* BONUS: post action in the action controller that successfully uploads the current imageview’s image up to your Parse backend.
Code Challenge: Write a function that determines how many words there are in a sentence
